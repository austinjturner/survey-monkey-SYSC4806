# Mini-SurveyMonkey - Group QuicknDirty

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/austinjturner/survey-monkey-SYSC4806.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/austinjturner/survey-monkey-SYSC4806)  
[Open App ðŸ”—](https://survey-monkey-sysc4806.herokuapp.com/)

This project contains the implementation of a web-app platform to create and respond to surveys, similar to [SurveyMonkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/).
The platform backend is written in Java using the [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) framework and data is stored in a 
persistent PostgreSQL database. 

This project is continuously integrated via [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) and deployed on [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps).

## State of the Project

- The project is now being tested via Travis CI and deployed to Heroku.
- The project uses PostgreSQL to persistently store entities
- Users can create a named survey with multiple questions
    - Only text-based questions currently
- Users can respond to the questions in an existing survey
    - Only text-based responses currently

## Plan for the Next Sprint
The next sprint will add the 2 additional questions types: Multiple choice and range input. The creator of the survey
should also be able to view some of the result data (maybe number based, rather than the complete graphical displays).
